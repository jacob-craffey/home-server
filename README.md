# Home Server

This is my Docker stack for my home server which uses:

- Plex for media
- Homarr as the server dashboard
- Dashdot for server hardware metrics
- Portainer for Docker GUI
- Haugene Transmission for BitTorrent client operating inside VPN
- Watchtower for automated container updates

Gonna make an actual README soon hopefully
